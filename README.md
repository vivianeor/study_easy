## Study Easy: A app built in Flutter with getX as state manager and Hive as database.

A study organizer with a calendar/schedule, to-do list, annotations and registration of subjects and notes.

An app built so that the student can concentrate things related to studies in one place, making it easier to organize.
I built this app using [hive](https://pub.dev/packages/hive) to save data locally and [getx](https://pub.dev/packages/get) for state management.
